# sorting

#### 1) Sorting012s: Sorting an array filled with only 0s, 1s and 2s. (Count Sort).

#### 2) QuickSort3: To force the given implementation of the quick sort algorithm to efficiently process sequences with few unique elements, your goal is replace a 2-way partition with a 3-way partition. That is, your new partition procedure should partition the array into three parts: < x part, = x part, and > x part.

#### 3) CountInversions: The goal in this problem is to count the number of inversions of a given sequence to sort the array.
